NYC Bikesharing – Story

## Overview of the Analysis
Using the Citi Bike program data and Tableau to analyze data and create visualizations, we can tell a story about New York’s bike-sharing program.  A solid business proposal for operating a bike-sharing program in Des Moines could be drawn by reflecting on NYC’s success. 


## Results
- Peak Hours of the Day
![Peak Hours of the Day](https://github.com/SzeWingChan/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Peak%20Hours%20of%20the%20Day.png)
  - The peak hours of the day are between 5:00 pm and 7:00 pm.
  - The best window for maintenance is between 2:00 am and 5:00 am as usage is the lowest. 

- Trips by Weekday for Each Hour
![Trips by Weekday for Each Hour](https://github.com/SzeWingChan/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Trips%20by%20Weekday%20for%20Each%20Hour.png)
  - It could be observed that there are two peaks during weekdays (Monday to Friday). The highest peak is between 5:00 pm and 8:00 pm and the secondary peak is between 8:00 am and 10:00 am.  It coincides with the peak commuting hours.
  -  A different pattern is shown for weekends as the usage remains high between 10:00 am and 5:00 pm.

- User Trips by Gender
![User Trips by Gender by Weekday](https://github.com/SzeWingChan/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/User%20Trips%20by%20Gender%20by%20Weekday.png)
  - Male subscribers are the main supporters of the bike-sharing program and their usage is around three times more than female subscribers on all weekdays. 
  - For the customer category, males use the bikes more often than females on all weekdays, but the ratio is between 1.4 and 2.0.

- Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
![Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)]( https://github.com/SzeWingChan/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Trips%20by%20Gender%20(Weekday%20per%20Hour).png)
  - From the graph, it is revealed that male users account for the majority of the trips.
  - However, peak hours of both male and female users show similar patterns – peak hours are between 5:00 pm and 8:00 pm and between 8:00 am and 10:00 am.

5. Trip Duration
![Trip Duration](https://github.com/SzeWingChan/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Trip%20Duration.png)
  - Majority of the bike trips are completed in 5 minutes and the number of trips decreases rapidly and the line falls flat when trips reach 50 minutes.  

- Trip Duration by Gender
![Trip Duration by Gender](https://github.com/SzeWingChan/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Trip%20Duration%20by%20Gender.png)
  - The same pattern is observed for both male and female bikers – most of the trips are completed in 5 minutes, and the number of trips decreases with a longer duration.  

- Bike Repairs

  - Bikes that are coloured in red and orange are the ones that would require more immediate maintenance as their usage is high compared to the rest of the bikes.  
  - Bikes that are coloured in yellow could be put on the waitlist and the bikes that are coloured in light and dark green could wait long as the utilization rate is the lowest.


## Summary
Summary of the Results
- It could be confirmed that the bike sharing program in New York is a great success.  
- A lot of the commuters use the bikes and this is supported by the evidence that the bikes are heavily used between peak commuting hours.
- It should be noted that the trip durations are short (most of the trips are completed in 5 minutes) and commuters could be using the bikes as their secondary transportation.
- It is observed that male subscribers are the main driving force for the bike program.

Future Analysis Suggestions
- Use the end station latitude and longitude and combine them with the end station name and trip data to find the most popular drop-off locations of the bikes.  
- Use the start station latitude and longitude and combine it with the end station name and trip data to find the most popular starting locations of the bikes.  
- Knowing the popular starting and ending locations can improve overall logistics (e.g. if there is a need to relocate bikes from one location to another).
- This can also help with bike utilization by moving less utilized bikes to the hot spots.  By doing so, the life span of the bikes could be even out and prevent breakdowns from high usage.
